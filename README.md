# Student-Refund-Selection-Funnel
This project looks at trends in student refund selection preferences aggregating data by total imports, financial aid disbursements, refund selection type broken out by year/month. 

1. First the SQL extract is created to get the student population, and clean up the data.
2. Then the file is exported and loaded into Excel
3. In Excel I created formulas that feed off the data sheet and create an aggregated funnel of student activity to better understand customer behavior- # of monthly student imports, financial aid refund selections by type (ACH, OPT IN, Check), #/$ of disbursements, % ratio of refund selectionr rate
